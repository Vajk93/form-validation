it's a form UI connected to react-hook-form to validate input values.

There is also a working, responsive, animated drop-down mobile menu.

This is just a wireframe, the colors are only there to distinguish the elements of the wireframe.

I did not upload the "node_modules" folder, it will have to be initialized and it will be completely fine.
